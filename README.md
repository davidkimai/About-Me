# Welcome

## Hi, I'm David Kim — welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a psychology researcher deeply passionate about researching neural networks, cognitive modeling, and the long-term psychological effects of interacting with large language models. I believe we're only beginning to understand how AI not only interprets our input, but subtly influences the way we think, reflect, and even remember.

This space is dedicated to exploring that frontier.

You'll find projects here that range from neural interpretability tools to investigations on how language models shape behavior, belief formation, and cognition over time. My goal is to contribute frameworks that help bridge neuroscience, AI safety, and human psychology in ways that benefit our long-term alignment with intelligent systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy storytelling, science fiction, and visualizing complex systems in ways that make them more human-understandable. I’m always curious about how we can use structure—not just speed—to solve problems more ethically and intelligently.

Thanks for visiting—feel free to explore, fork, or connect. I believe there's a lot to learn ahead!
